# Production code map

Snapshot at the current DFS implementation source, including request-audit logging. Every production Python module is listed below, along with Java/build adapters and experiment scripts. Tests/data/docs have an exhaustive [file index](FILE_INDEX.md). [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) explains interactions and important function contracts; [function index](FUNCTION_INDEX.md) supplies definitions and source lines.
