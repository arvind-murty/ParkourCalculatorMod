# Current standalone state

2026-11-03. Runtime implementation boundary: `498c054c`; additive request/branch logging: `072a1111`. [DFS/interaction results](../autonomy/experiments/dfs-interactions/README.md) records current validation and exact cold/resume evidence. Earlier experiment reports describe their own revisions. The root AGENTS files remain unchanged.

## What exists

`ipopt` solves fixed-input continuous horizontal trajectories, with independent scalar validation, subprocess isolation, incumbent retention and prescribed contact/vertical/ladder support. `autonomy` builds discrete movement/input/contact programs with existing Java physics and constraint helpers. `cell_routes` decomposes player configuration space and guides a selected spatial corridor. Earlier disk/SOCP/mixed-input experiments remain in `route_guidance`; they are not the selected search implementation.

The seven earlier workstreams remain: explicit solve scope/identity, scoped corridor projection, shared reachability, fixed constraints before numerical solves, state/schedule retention helpers, generator/terminal repair persistence and conservative dead-fall exclusion. The current change fixes their incomplete early wiring and replaces outer traversal.

## Implemented DFS and early interaction changes

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Traversal | `find_checkpoint_route` delegates to `depth_first.search_goals`. Compare arrivals at a common spatial goal, then follow the chosen child deeply. No global checkpoint-window drain barrier. |
| Goal ordering | `(validated absolute arrival, -effective grounded jumps, grounded nonjump runs, stable identity)`. Shorter simulated prefixes organize local generation only. Explicit initial-jump families are compared before selection. |
| Scoring | Fixed goal-contact programs have known schedule durations. Evaluate necessary earlier alternatives; save later arrivals and optional refinements rather than waiting for all numerical work. First feasibility still requires scene/vertical/corridor acceptance. |
| Candidate promotion | Continue the actual validated arrival program plus selected hard constraints. Earlier facings and the original horizontal state remain free/fixed respectively; no optimized endpoint is frozen. |
| Terminal work | Test existing normal jump/run-off air continuations first, then retain generic symbolic terminal generation and refinements. A direct continuation has the same full constraints/checks as other candidates. |
| Early interaction gate | `interactions.InteractionGate` uses compiled original-state prefix/approach envelopes before open normal/stepping/ceiling builders expand block rows. Required full-proposal checks, avoidance phases, floor checks and derived corridor gates use the shared query. Unknown keeps coverage. |
| Generation | Per-obstacle partial nodes/options and cross-obstacle partial effective models dedup before expensive leaf refinement; resource distinctions remain where relevant. Complete keys are checked before LP refinement. |
| Ownership | Generated row bundles carry owner completion states. Full proposals are screened before truncation; uncommitted removed events lose their approach rows. Promotion cannot copy those orphan rows back from a longer witness. |
| Retention | DFS preserves scored siblings, unscored proposals, unknowns, inner search and accepted constraint variants. It currently performs **no new heuristic peer exclusion**. Existing position/velocity/schedule helpers remain available. |
| Persistence | Version5 `ordered_goal_dfs` state stores frames, active/in-flight work, generators, siblings, refinements, suspended work and incumbent. Numerical progress does not change candidate identity. Each unfinished frame has one execution owner. |

The [approved plan](../autonomy/DFS_INTERACTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) remains the design record. [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [code map](CODE_MAP.md), [runbook](RUNBOOK.md) and [testing](TESTING.md) describe interfaces and validation. Spatial goals no longer require corresponding absolute-clock windows; supplied clocks remain diagnostics. A fixed-clock task does not imply a final landing.

## Durable requirements

- All inputs, events and hard constraints are fixed before IPOPT. Reuse builders; no new fractional decisions or continuous equations.
- Re-solve from the original position/stored velocity with all previous facings variable. Carry ordinary momentum with zero inertia thresholds.
- Compare time at the same spatial goal and objective at a compatible common clock. Keep current 0.25-block/1-tick margins; don't invent a weighted score. Preserving all DFS siblings also preserves agreed state/schedule protections.
- Proved impossible required interaction rejects its proposal; proved absent contact contributes no prevention choice or interaction-derived check. Unknown is not feasible, infeasible or dominated. Swept Y→X→Z phases matter.
- Full terminal acceptance requires the declared scene/horizon/objective. A preliminary witness cannot become a final incumbent. Keep physical and corridor acceptance distinct, with diagnostics.
- Generic algorithms, no Real11 IDs/ticks/coordinates in production rules, no reference seeds in cold discovery, no silent domain/cap increases.

## Evidence and remaining limits

The archived pre-DFS corpus stalled at state28 after208 worker calls over~910s; all172 main numerical calls were feasible. A first DFS diagnostic reached a full state64 solution through the delayed setup in eight calls, independently replayed. Current source-matched cold/resume measurements live in the [results](../autonomy/experiments/dfs-interactions/README.md); distinguish them from that earlier diagnostic and seeded reference controls.

DFS chooses the most promising **evaluated** candidate, not a proven globally earliest unseen arrival. Local generation and catalogue caps can suspend work; numerical unknowns remain unknown. There is no new admissible global objective bound. A completed incumbent does not prove slower local arrivals lose the final objective. Search inside one branch can still be large, and a root fallback can remain pending while closer siblings are explored. State/report size grows with retained evidence.

The gate is available whenever a compiled movement context exists; contexts without it retain unknown choices. The approach gate leaves post-contact Y unconstrained before a stepping/ceiling outcome is chosen, then checks the full proposed model. Existing interval/LP screens are conservative/numerical respectively, not rational certificates. Complete acceptance and original-state replay remain essential.

One supplied corridor (or the first automatically enumerated corridor) is searched per call. No claim of all-map, all-catalogue or global continuous optimality follows. Exact executable float-angle replay/export and actual-world validation remain separate from standalone continuous/scene acceptance.

## Deferred

Discrete decision transfer between completed/sibling solves; new global objective bounding; new mixed-integer/SOCP decision search; water; ladder/intentional wall-hit expansion; redesign of all spatial route enumeration. Existing ladder/replay code stays implemented. Weak coupling between separated decisions is provisional; use retained alternatives and evidence when a map contradicts it.


Named step/grind events need special care in **the shared envelope**, not separate relevance rules. Realized Y endpoints omit the movement probes that trigger those cases. Such phases keep Y unknown and include intended, unclipped X/Z movement in their outer bounds. The existing case builders and full scene checks decide validity. This restored the generic five-input grind→air→blip regression, which an overly tight realized-Y query had incorrectly removed. Precise probe-height envelopes are a possible later performance refinement; never infer vertical noninteraction for these phases from realized feet height alone.


Final recorded acceptance:368 non-ladder autonomy tests and54 IPOPT tests pass;25 post-logging repair/terminal tests pass. Cold Real11 reaches a first full route in91.22s/eight calls; two150s sessions make14 calls total with zero repeated completed requests and all10/18 witness replays passing. Best Z64 is−1094.5755032869683. The zero-run root alternative remains pending; the known seeded reference is about1.308 blocks farther. See source-specific logs/results rather than treating this as global optimality or a fully green ladder-inclusive suite.
