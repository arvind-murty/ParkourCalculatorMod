# Reusing the broader Parkour Calculator

All relative links below resolve inside the **physical research worktree**. From the main checkout's symlinked standalone directory, do not navigate via its logical `..` to read a different code revision.

## Orientation and rules

- [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md): domain vocabulary, ticks, velocity versus displacement, jump/landing names, stepping cases.
- [Root AGENTS](../../AGENTS.md): module navigation, Java/toolchain and integration constraints. Left unchanged by this documentation pass. The user's standalone test scope governs ordinary work here.
- [Physics mirror](../../docs/reference/mcpk): authoritative legacy movement constants, collision order and community mechanics; [vision](../../docs/VISION.md), [coding guide](../../docs/CODING_GUIDE.md), [contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md): broader design and module conventions.
- [Research](../../docs/research): native angle-solver design and recovery investigations. Consult when lifting an existing method, not as an instruction to integrate this prototype into the UI.

| Mod wiring if explicitly integrating later | [Application.java](../../core/src/main/java/de/legoshi/parkourcalc/core/Application.java); input/start changes must retrigger simulation. Existing standalone work does not alter that wiring. |

## Constraint derivation runbook

Use [CONSTRAINT_GENERATION_RUNBOOK.md](../autonomy/CONSTRAINT_GENERATION_RUNBOOK.md) for exact conventions. The mod's key-selection flow supplies support boxes, nearby obstacle boxes, reference point, facing and collision mode to `deriveFootprint`. `SupportOverlap` includes precise player overhang; obstacle clipping handles body/corners. The standalone convenience footprint operation currently passes no obstacle list, so it is not a replacement for neighbor-aware derivation. [DeriveSelectedFootprints.java](../autonomy/experiments/linkcraft11-opening/DeriveSelectedFootprints.java) demonstrates calling the real code with neighbors.

A GUI-selected footprint rectangle is one selected region, not the full nonconvex support domain. Preserve unions as multiple support regions/cells with the same physical owner; never create collision walls on artificial seams. The player's legacy half-width is float-promoted `0.30000001192092896`, height is float-promoted `1.8F`. Do not use hand-rounded `0.3` in tight production constraints or expand already-authored player-center rows twice.

Core and forge-core remain MC-free Java 8 code; loader code is MC-specific. Standalone Java helpers reuse compiled current sources. A local helper build is different from launching Minecraft or running mod-wide test suites. If changing shared Java, read its module rules and validate that change appropriately; Python/docs iteration does not justify rebuilding all loaders.
