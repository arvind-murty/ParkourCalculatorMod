# Documentation index

All tracked standalone Markdown plus this consolidation. Read [AGENTS](../AGENTS.md) and [current state](CURRENT_STATE.md) first. Historical documents are preserved to explain decisions and measurements, not all made current by this index. A status label is not an assertion that every source-era sentence has been rewritten.
