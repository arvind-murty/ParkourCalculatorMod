# Real11 candidate questions, answered in order

2026-11-03. This document answers the user questions sequentially. Each answer is written before investigating the next question. Evidence comes from the saved cold sessions and existing generator/scheduler; no search-policy change or new IPOPT solve is implied.

## 1. Are P01/P02 the primary candidates, and P03/P04/P05 continuations of P01?

Yes. They are two initial setup families within the same prescribed spatial route, not two different spatial routes:

| Program | Initial setup through state10 | Later committed/proposed inputs | Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P01 | Jump at input0 | None yet at state10 | Initial immediate-jump family |
| P02 | Run inputs0..7; jump at8 | None yet at state10 | Initial delayed-jump family |
| P03 | Exactly P01 through10 | Return to B1 at12; jump12; land B2 at21; jump21 | P01 continuation to28 |
| P04 | Exactly P01 through10 | Same inputs/contacts as P03; extra B4 approach row at28 | P01 continuation; orphan future-condition issue already identified |
| P05 | Exactly P01 through10 | Same inputs/contacts as P03; different B4 approach row at28 | P01 continuation; same issue |

The position-Y, vertical-velocity, ground, jump and sneak histories through10 match P01 exactly for P03/P04/P05. Both P01 and P02 were retained after the state10 comparison. Choosing P03 for evaluation did not discard P02.

## 2. Why was P01 continued before P02?

For numerical evaluation, the scheduler uses `(prefix inputs, -effective jumps, grounded run inputs, stable ID)`. It does not use the spatial-probe arrival time or promise to alternate initial families.

| Candidate | Processing key, before stable ID | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P01 | (10, -1, 0) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |
| P02 | (10, -1, 8) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |
| P03 | (28, -3, 0) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |
| P06 | (28, -2, 4) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |
| P07 | (28, -2, 5) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |
| Q02 | (28, -2, 8) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |
| Q09 | (28, -2, 10) | Lower tuple runs first among available candidates |

At state10, both setups have one jump, so P01's zero runs rank before P02's eight. At state28, P03/P04/P05 have three effective jumps and zero runs, so they rank ahead of the available delayed-setup continuations with two jumps. This is the explicit mechanical reason; no proof that the P01 family gives the best final route was used.

There are two meanings of continuation here. P02 was continued by the symbolic generator: its descendants exist in the ready queue. It was not continued by a main state28 numerical evaluation before the deadline. The saved20-program ready queue contains 13 initial-jump8 descendants and 7 initial-jump0 descendants. Some delayed-setup candidates reach B3 symbolically, but have not been numerically accepted.

The fixture sets fair_parents=true, but decision_windows.fair_programs explicitly sends persistent generation through one shared queue instead of its per-parent fairness loop. Therefore that setting did not guarantee a turn for P02. This is an ordering/coverage limitation, not evidence that P02 was worse or discarded.

## 3. Why were P06/P07 introduced before P01/P03 completed?

P06/P07 are other continuations of P01, not new primary setups and not descendants of P03:

| Branch | History after the initial jump0 | State28 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P03 | B1 return12, jump12, B2 landing21, jump21 | Airborne toward B3 |
| P06 | B1 return12, run12..15, jump16, B1 return28 | Grounded on B1 again |
| P07 | B1 return12, run12..16, jump17 | Still airborne, no B2 landing selected |

The orchestrator generates a pool of sibling prefixes to the next fixed checkpoint. It does not finish one initial family or one promising prefix all the way to64 before considering siblings. P03's local state28 solve did finish: two worker calls produced an accepted physical prefix and its constraint source was exhausted. Its full route did not finish because advancing to state44 was blocked until the entire state28 window finished.

P06 was then evaluated, and its unfinished constraint source repeatedly re-entered the same available-work queue. Its key(28,-2,4) continued to outrank P07's(28,-2,5) and the available two-jump delayed-setup candidates with eight or more run inputs. Completing another8s evaluation chunk did not change that key. P06 received29 chunks; P07 subsequently received50. They consumed120 and44 main worker calls respectively.

Thus the problem is not that P03 needed more IPOPT work before it could be used. A window-completion barrier prevented using it downstream, while a static priority rule let unfinished sibling work monopolize the window. Saving the frontier made that work resumable but did not make scheduling fair. Changing only end-of-window retention cannot recover the time spent before that retention is reached.

## 4. Why were P06/P07 attempted at all?

Because the configured movement domain permits them, not because the primary candidates failed or a heuristic showed these waits were necessary:

- initialJumpInputs=[0,8] restricts only the first takeoff. It does not prohibit later run inputs.
- The fixture permits64 total run inputs and64 per jump. Normal generation tries jumping and not jumping when grounded, and visits every supplied support including the current B1. Repeated one-input supported returns therefore construct arbitrary waits; self-return jumps are also generated.
- SupportOrder permits repeated contacts with the current support. It requires the complete B2/B3/B4/B5 order only by terminal state64, not by the intermediate state28 checkpoint.
- The current dead-prefix test cannot reject grounded P06. Descending P07 can still have a first floor contact on B1, so it also survives. This test does not prove that the remaining mandatory support sequence can finish by64.

Both are locally legal proposed histories in that broad domain. Their relevant B1/B2 interactions cannot simply be discarded as unreachable. The shared early interaction fix therefore addresses their redundant/irrelevant constraint generation but does not, by itself, prove the entire timing family useless.

The implementation allowed later waits without establishing their usefulness and then spent most of the window elaborating them. Their poor observed progress/B3-arrival scores do not certify global inferiority, but they also do not justify exhausting them before giving other families numerical coverage. Any hard exclusion should follow a sound remaining-continuation argument or an explicitly agreed decision-domain restriction; provisional scheduling is a separate issue.

## 5. Was 8 the minimum run count? Why try16 run ticks and nothing between8 and16?

There is a numbering mix-up:16 and17 are absolute second-jump input indices, not counts of run inputs.

| Program | Jump inputs | Actual grounded nonjump inputs before state28 | Run count | B2 reached in main prefix? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P01/P03 setup | 0, then12, then21 in P03 | None | 0 | Yes, P03 lands B2 at21 after a B1 self-hop |
| P02 setup | 8 | 0..7 | 8 | The saved spatial probe reaches B2 at17; main P02 ends at10 |
| P06 | 0,16 | 12..15 | 4 | No; returns to B1 at28 |
| P07 | 0,17 | 12..16 | 5 | No; still airborne at28 |

So we did not attempt sixteen run ticks in P06. We attempted a second takeoff at absolute input16 after four later run ticks. Eight is not a global minimum run count for reaching B2: P03 already reaches it with zero grounded nonjump inputs by using a self-hop on B1. If the question means the minimum for a direct single jump from B1 to B2, the current cold experiment does not establish it: first-jump0/8 was an explicitly selected domain, not the output of a minimum-run proof.

If “between8 and16” means first takeoffs9..15, those were excluded by the selected initialJumpInputs=[0,8]. If it means later takeoffs12..15, they were generated. These saved shorter prefixes remain pending expansion:

| Pending prefix | Jump inputs | Run inputs after B1 return12 | State / selected support | Numerically evaluated as a state28 continuation? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F01 | [0, 12] | [] | 24 / b1 | No |
| F02 | [0, 13] | [12] | 25 / b1 | No |
| F03 | [0, 13] | [12] | 22 / b2 | No |
| F04 | [0, 14] | [12, 13] | 26 / b1 | No |
| F05 | [0, 14] | [12, 13] | 23 / b2 | No |
| F06 | [0, 15] | [12, 13, 14] | 27 / b1 | No |
| F07 | [0, 15] | [12, 13, 14] | 24 / b2 | No |

These are evidence of generation, not numerical feasibility or optimality. P03 is the already-evaluated immediate second-jump12/B2-landing21 sibling. The unexpanded22/23/24-input B2 prefixes could produce further three-jump continuations to28, but those are not yet main-scored. The first ready batch was not an exhaustive enumeration sorted over every possible future continuation: generation and numerical scheduling have separate queues. A full ready batch plus repeated numerical continuations prevented additional symbolic expansion from bringing every potentially higher-priority child into view.

## 6. Was the search effectively consumed by extraneous work?

Yes, the measured work was severely unbalanced. “Extraneous” here means over-elaboration and unproved-useful branches; it does not certify that every distinct P06/P07 model can be safely deleted.

| Initial family | Main worker calls | Spatial-probe worker calls | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P01 family (initial jump0) | 171 | 30 | 201 |
| P02 family (initial jump8) | 1 | 6 | 7 |

P06/P07 alone consumed164 of172 main worker calls (95.3%), plus12 spatial-probe calls:176 of208 calls overall (84.6%). All172 main worker returns were numerically feasible. The work included many distinct avoidance/route-repair constraint combinations for the same two movement schedules, not164 attempts to discover new takeoff times. Generation also spent substantial time on duplicate descriptions that never became fresh worker calls.

The three sessions spent about910 seconds and still never advanced beyond the state28 comparison window. That is a real structural coverage failure: P03's accepted prefix did not get a downstream completion attempt, P02's state28 descendants got no main numerical evaluation, and20 ready programs plus16 symbolic prefixes remained. It was not exhaustion of the whole route domain.

The causes are separable:

1. The declared domain permits unstructured later waits/self-returns. Initial0/8 restricts only the first takeoff.
2. Static prefix priority repeatedly selects already-started P06/P07 refinement over waiting candidates; fair_parents does not alternate families in persistent mode.
3. The fixed checkpoint window must drain before a promising accepted prefix advances, so later route completion cannot provide feedback soon enough.
4. Late interaction filtering/canonicalization and the orphan approach-row bug create unnecessary generation/refinement work.

The interaction-gate plan addresses item4. It does not by itself fix family allocation, the window barrier or prove all later waits useless. Those require an explicit scheduling/decision-domain plan rather than increasing budgets and assuming the current queue eventually gives useful coverage. No runtime change was made while answering these questions.
