# Real11 retry after the handoff push

The user reauthorized a fresh combined initial0/8 solve after pushing the branch and writing the [corridor-agent handoff](../../../docs/CORRIDOR_AGENT_HANDOFF.md). The fork branch was verified at `61355976` before launch. This run uses that source, the unchanged [virtual-finish fixture](../virtual-finish/fixture.json), the same candidate limits and300-second budget, and local-run policy1. No recorded prefix/yaw is supplied. Corridor/cell behavior and the continuous model are unchanged.

[Raw report](evidence/real11-retry-after-handoff.json.gz), [run log](evidence/real11-retry-after-handoff.log), [verified summary](evidence/real11-retry-summary.json) and [all12 numerical requests](REAL11_RETRY_CALLS.md) preserve exact requests, scope/branch diagnostics, excluded programs and continuation state. `summarize_retry.py` reuses the existing DFS auditor to verify request hashes, original state, zero thresholds, variable facings, unique active frame ownership and independent replay.

## Result

| Measurement | Fresh combined retry |
| --- | --- |
| Best discovered finish | 67 |
| Z67 | −1093.8231291279699 |
| Final X | 728.850632960287 |
| Actual Y / on ground | 7 / true, physical B7 collision |
| Jump inputs | 8,19,30,43,58 |
| Required support arrivals | B2@17, B3@28, B4@40, B5@58 |
| First complete solution | 101.85s /8 worker calls |
| Worker calls in whole session | 12 |
| Independent witness replay checks | 13/13 pass |
| Local-run exclusions | 9 |
| Repeated identical problem hashes | 0 |
| Actual search elapsed | 317.53s |
| Termination | deadline, unfinished work saved |

First completion is the free-air variant after call8; call9 supplies the better-Z physical-contact incumbent. Reported elapsed includes progress persistence and post-deadline handling. This run did not overlap another numerical test suite. Neither minimum time nor maximum Z is certified. The initial0 root sibling remains saved and uncontinued; the older independent initial0 diagnostic at64 is not rediscovered by this combined run.

## What pruning changed

After call7 validated B4 arrival40→jump43→B5 arrival58, the rule learned **three local runs** for that interaction pattern. It excluded jumps44–52 that simply continue standing on B4 (local4–12 runs), before numerical dispatch. In particular, the pre-policy run4/8/9 prefix requests corresponding to old cold10–12 were not dispatched. Source and fixture contain no hardcoded3/4 threshold.

Calls8 and9 persist, as requested, with no change to corridor handling. They have the same inputs but different final-contact constraints (free overshoot and physical B7 collision). The archived corridor-induced distinctions and repairs remain visible for the other agent; no special-case suppression or deduplication was introduced here.

The total still reaches12 worker calls because saved work is redirected elsewhere:

- New call10 proposes an extra B4 self-jump, with jumps40 and52 before B5 arrival67. Its latest jump has **zero** runs after landing back on B4 at52. That is a different prior interaction history from standing on B4 from40 to52, so the local-run rule correctly does not merge it. Worker feasibility was returned but the overall evaluation remains unknown at its deadline.
- New call11 revisits B5@58 with the same3-run preparation and one additional avoidance row, `X[56] >= 731.3000010119209`, labelled `blockage:5` (B6). Equal-run constraint variants remain eligible. The stored prefix model has240 rows versus239 for call7.
- New call12 continues that variant to the free-air finish at67, with273 rows versus272 for call8. The added row is the same B6 avoidance row, not a `cell_corridor` row. Do not attribute every remaining extra request to corridor repair without inspecting its rows.

All12 request hashes are distinct. This is an exact-model accounting statement, not a claim that every remaining request is globally necessary. More time reasoning and discrete decision reuse remain deferred; corridor/cell improvement belongs to the other agent. The saved state and ledger allow those costs to be inspected without rerunning this experiment.

## Publication and reproduction

The first fork publication used SSH after HTTPS transport failures/stalls; `origin` remains configured to the user's HTTPS fork and tracks `origin/research/ipopt-cell-routes`. No force push or pull request was used. The handoff was pushed and its remote hash verified before this solve.

Use the native environment in the [runbook](../../../docs/RUNBOOK.md), choose a new output filename, and run the existing `cell_routes.fixed_clock_experiment` CLI against `virtual-finish/fixture.json`. For an offline summary only:

```sh
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" .venv-guidance/bin/python \
  standalone/autonomy/experiments/last-jump-runs/summarize_retry.py \
  --input standalone/autonomy/experiments/last-jump-runs/evidence/real11-retry-after-handoff.json.gz \
  --output /tmp/real11-retry-summary.json --calls /tmp/real11-retry-calls.md
```

No production code or test expectations were changed for this retry. The52 focused regression acceptance remains the latest implementation gate.
