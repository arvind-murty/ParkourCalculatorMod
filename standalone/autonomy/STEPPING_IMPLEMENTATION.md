# Stepping and normal-air ceiling implementation

2026-10-30, isolated worktree `ParkourCalculatorMod-run-ticks`, branch `codex/run-ticks-planning`. Ladder-ceiling ownership changes are deferred. Existing ladder ceiling routes still use their existing scheduling behavior, with neutral helpers extracted for reuse. Water and route/input pruning remain later work.

## Generation and representation

The full `collision_boxes` support graph now calls the registered `stepping` and `ceiling` generators alongside normal movement. Legacy support-plane generation and import names remain compatible. Ordinary jumps are retained beside the new alternatives.

| Type | Named case | Input producing the named state | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stepping | normal_step | Ground/run | One-input rise through 0.6, grounded |
| stepping | slab_boost | Ground/jump | Rise above jump impulse through 0.6, not grounded; one air input follows |
| stepping | blip | Air into H | H at higher top, grounded |
| stepping | blip_up | Air into H | H retains yL, grounded without a fabricated support |
| stepping | corner_jump_cancel | Ground/jump into J | X-facing approach, next-state Z escape, zero rise, airborne |
| stepping | corner_blip_up | Air into H | X-facing L/H corner escape, retained yL, grounded |
| ceiling | ceiling_hit | Normal upward air, or initial jump | Actual underside plane and zero vertical carry before gravity/drag |
| ceiling | grind | Ground/jump into J | Outside before J, under low ceiling on J, zero rise; ordinary air follows |

`case_profiles` builds named case constraints and reuses `vertical_profiles` plus the existing scalar movement functions. `stepping_generation` owns support/corner case proposals. `ceiling_generation` owns normal ceiling/grind proposals and normal airborne ceiling prediction through the registry. `ceiling_primitives` owns shared underside/profile/sequence helpers; old `ceiling_contacts.ceiling_profile` and `mixed_ladder.ceiling_sequence` imports remain adapters.

Profiles record Y/VY/ground history, explicit jump inputs, relative case events and position constraints. `profile_program` splits a case's physical input from its ordinary prefix/tail. `compile_block_path` retains actual landing phase; a blip checks lower L separately from higher H. Run insertion shifts the program, controls, L/H/J anchors, positional rows, finite contacts and scene contracts once. Profile controls are authoritative, and contradictory/malformed unit controls are rejected.

Normal-air ceiling units survive between ladder units. Overlay never replaces a ladder-owned interval with the normal ceiling type, including an entry-producing climb input. Existing ladder ceiling generation is preserved; its new dedicated local handler has not been introduced.

## Blip wall handling

On L the higher block is an ordinary finite obstacle. Generate four outside-face alternatives and four real face-hit alternatives. A real hit uses a standard `role=contact` event, rather than a reversal event. Shared contact compilation supplies its finite-face constraints, inertia cancellation and actual sprint state. The following input remains air into H even after the horizontal hit.

Normal blip-up additionally requires being outside the higher block on L. Otherwise the Y-first resolver lands on that block normally before the planned step. Corner cases share X-approach and next-state Z-escape constraints. No avoided corner face is turned into a retained horizontal hit. Z-facing counterparts do not receive the X-facing cancel/retained-height result.

## Elevated continuation and acceptance

The blip-up unit ends at H. Its following normal interval either jumps from the retained height or consumes a ground-regime input and continues through ordinary air to a real floor. Both choices are generated within one complete support-to-support profile. No optimizer X/Z position or velocity is fixed at H, and no block at the elevated Y is fabricated.

The scalar contact format has named outcome cases for zero-rise and retained-height events, without introducing another Minecraft step resolver. The Java acceptance bridge still uses shared `StaticScene.move`. A named case must match a selected real step, a real triggering finite solid, the complete predicted position/ground state and carried velocity. Unexpected step resolution is rejected. The bridge no longer demands that a retained-height result equal a nonexistent block top. Standard step contracts retain their existing checks.

Every accepted route is a fresh full-history IPOPT solution plus scalar and shared-scene acceptance. Game replay/export is outside this orchestration milestone.

## Bounds and work limits

The ordinary jump-height gate no longer rejects composite full-geometry profiles before the stepping generator can propose them. Flight-bound cache keys retain complete jump/ground schedules, including elevated second jumps, while keeping legacy keys for classic movement. Reach bounds use each profile's actual input schedule. A cheap initial support/constraint intersection check rejects only empty entry regions.

`maxSteppingProfiles` defaults to 128 per source/target pair. The graph reports emitted counts and incomplete generation; an incomplete stepping pool cannot establish `minimumTicksProven`. This is a bounded family of candidates, not exhaustive movement or a global optimality proof. Existing contact/solver/route budgets continue to apply.

The current automatic case family contains one named stepping event per full support leg, with an ordinary continuation and optional elevated jump for blip-up. Arbitrary chains of new stepping events within the same airborne leg, or automatic selection of a step into an airborne ladder entry, are follow-up composition work. Existing multi-ladder chains and support-to-support mixes retain their current behavior. No rarity pruning, dominance rule, new cache or resumable enumeration has been added.

## Validation

`tests/test_stepping_cases.py` covers scalar height/control windows, the hypothetical free H crossing, retained Y and carry, all case anchor/control/contact retiming, unit-control rejection, ladder ownership, X-facing versus mirrored Z-facing controls, both horizontal axes for normal stepping, and cold geometry discovery across the catalogue. The height-bound regression generates a composite blip-up transition above the original ordinary jump-height limit.

Fresh numerical/shared-scene cases cover normal step, slab boost, blip avoidance, blip wall hit, blip-up with jump and no-jump continuations, both corner cases, flat grind and grind followed by a lower floor. Removing selected case contracts is rejected by scene acceptance. Fixtures contain geometry, initial state and a discrete case index, with no supplied airtimes, solved facings or frozen intermediate states. Existing ceiling/wall combinations and ladder regressions remain separate gates.

Focused new suite: 15 methods passed, including nine saved geometry/case fixtures and additional fresh numerical controls. Full orchestration and numerical regression totals are recorded in COMPACTION_HANDOFF.md after the final run.
